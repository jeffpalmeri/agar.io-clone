# agar.io-clone

The aim of this project was to create a replica of the popular multiplayer game agar.io. My personal goal was to gain experience with socket.io
and game development mechanics. 

More specifically, I wanted to get practice using socket.io in a
more advanced implimentation than the typical 'chat app' used to learn the basics of socket.io. Also, I had some basic experience with JavaScript game development,
canvas animations, and collision detection (which I learned through this mdn tutorial: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript),
but wanted to implament these techniques in amore challenging fashion.
